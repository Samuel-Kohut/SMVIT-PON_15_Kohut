## About Me

Hi, my name is **Samuel KohÃºt**, and Iâ€™m currently finishing my Masterâ€™s degree in **Intelligent Software Systems (ISS)** at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. I already hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and am now in my final 5th year of studies.



ðŸ’» **Background \& Experience**



* Iâ€™ve worked on various academic and personal projects, ranging from data structures, web applications and games to AI-driven solutions such as **face recognition** and **reinforcement learning in Atari games** (my diploma thesis).
* Professionally, Iâ€™ve gained over 2.5 years of experience as a **Backend Developer in Java**, where I focused on building web applications. Before that, I worked two years in the logistics sector at Metro supermarket.
* My technical strengths lie in **coding**, problem-solving, and building practical software systems.



ðŸŽ¹ **Current Project**  


For my Systems Thinking course, Iâ€™m working on a **LED Piano Trainer**. This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico and LEDs to gamify the learning process for piano beginners. Instead of traditional sheet music, LEDs light up to guide which keys to press, making learning feel more like playing a game.



ðŸš€ **Interests \& Goals**



* I enjoy **backend programming, web development, and creating projects that solve real problems**.
* While Iâ€™ve done a lot of work in AI, itâ€™s not where I see my long-term future â€” I prefer coding, building systems, and exploring **gamification concepts** that make learning fun.
* Long term, I see myself growing as a **skilled developer**, either working on impactful projects or creating something of my own.



ðŸŽ¯ **Fun Facts**



* Born in **Snina, Slovakia**, a small city in the east.
* In my free time, I enjoy **rock climbing, gaming, watching YouTube, anime, and reading manga**.
* I love music, even though Iâ€™ve never played an instrument myself â€” this makes the LED piano project even more exciting for me, as I hope to share it with my younger family members.
